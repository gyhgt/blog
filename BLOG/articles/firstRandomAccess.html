                <h2>And I said I was nearly finished... Just had the heart attack of my life and I think I will forever backup my code 
                    before changing anything severe for the rest of my life x</h2>
                <p>Maybe the whole random access thing can be the name for this blog diary thing?<br><br>Anyway 
                so last time I was typing something here I tried saying how this was nearly finished (last night) and while that might
            still be true the result of tonight was me making a stupid error and thinking that my code had a root flaw causing it to just
         not work xx I referenced the wrong css file. Because I copied across html files. This has become quite a fixation of mine so perhaps
        I might figure a way of hosting this on my domain by tomorrow night?<br><br>
    Im quite impressed with myself really to be able to get this far in html and css within a week (from 0 to a website) and this place will be
updated as I get better hopefully. For now, goodbye!!</p>
