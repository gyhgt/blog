                <h1>Neuromancer - William Gibson</h1>
                <h3>03-10-24</h3>
                <h2>★★★<br><br>I thought the descriptions were so cool and awesome but the plot was so hard to follow
                </h2>
                <p>It was such a weird book like so many things happened. It was like the author was just 'what can I get away with now that
                    this is set in the future so basically anything can happen' I think that was why the plot felt so random although 
                    it didn't have my full attention sometimes so that might have helped xx <br>It was fun though to see what the 'cyberspace' 
                    would look like to someone in 1984 as a lot of the futuristic ideas actually seemed pretty close to us now. Also the fact 
                    that it inspired the matrix and also one of my favourite games (Cyberpunk 2077) was both clear and fun to see. <br><br>Cover image is from 
                one of the covers.                </p>
